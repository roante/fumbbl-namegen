====

- Use namesmaces to prevent messing up other (future) scripts on the buy player page
- Compile link of resources to the HTML site
- How to upgrade?
- Create script to minify javascript
- Eliminate all toArray() calls


- Notes:
  - Be patient for the first time -- the JS file is a bit big (xk) and takes a few second to load. Then it's going to be cached so it won't take too long until the next update of the script.
